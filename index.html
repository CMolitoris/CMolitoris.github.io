        <p>
            &emsp;I recently separated from the U.S. Army with almost a decade of service. I served in high-stress combat roles
            as an infantryman as well as in highly technical ones as a clinical laboratory scientist. Later I became a 
            Non-Commissioned Officer, where I led Soldiers and directed the completion of tasks.

            &emsp;I am a junior in an applied computer science program at George Mason University 
            and have a degree in laboratory technology from George Washington University. I am passionate and dedicated
            to the world of technology and development and strive to become an effective and experienced engineer.
